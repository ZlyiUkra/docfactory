An example repository demonstrating how to use **Upstash Realtime** with the **AI SDK** and **Upstash Workflows** to create a durable chat application with human-in-the-loop functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- **Durable AI Streams**: Chat conversations persist even if the browser is refreshed or closed
- **Real-time Communication**: Powered by Upstash Realtime for seamless streaming
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Tool execution requires user approval before running
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark theme
- **Weather Tool**: Example tool that demonstrates approval workflow
- **Chat History**: Persistent conversation history stored in Redis
- **Streaming Animation**: Smooth text streaming with markdown rendering

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application combines several powerful technologies:

- **Upstash Realtime**: Real-time event streaming
- **Vercel AI SDK**: Modern AI integration with React
- **Upstash Workflows**: Durable function execution
- **Upstash Redis**: Data persistence

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this application, you'll need:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or later)
2. **Bun** package manager (recommended) or npm
3. **Upstash Account**: Sign up at upstash.com
4. **OpenAI API Key**: Get one from platform.openai.com

## 🛠️ Setup

Start by cloning the repository and going to the example app directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:upstash/workflow-js.git
cd workflow-js/examples/upstash-realtime-ai-sdk
```

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Upstash Redis Configuration
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_redis_token

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Qstash/Workflow Configuration
QSTASH_TOKEN=
```

### 3. Upstash Setup

1. **Create a Redis Database**:

   - Go to Upstash Console
   - Create a new Redis database
   - Copy the REST URL and token

2. **Establish a QStash Server**:
   - For dev environment, you should run `npx @upstash/qstash-cli@latest dev` in the terminal to start QStash local dev server.
   - Set the QSTASH_TOKEN in your `.env.local` file (set QSTASH_URL too if you are using local dev server)

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
bun dev
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Durable Streams

The application implements durable AI streams that survive browser refreshes and network interruptions:

1. **Message Persistence**: All chat messages are stored in Redis with unique IDs
2. **Stream Recovery**: When reconnecting, the app resumes from the last message
3. **Workflow Execution**: AI generation runs in Upstash Workflows for reliability

### Human-in-the-Loop

The weather tool demonstrates the approval workflow:

1. User asks about weather
2. AI requests permission to execute the weather tool
3. User can approve or reject the tool execution
4. Only approved tools actually execute

### Real-time Communication

- Upstash Realtime allows us to stream the processes going on with the workflows on the server side
to client in realtime.
- In this example, we use realtime to stream each chunk created by aisdk to the client side,
integrated with useChat hook.
